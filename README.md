# üõ†Ô∏è TCPDump Project

## üìù Objective
This project demonstrates how to set up a web server on Kali Linux, host a login form, and use TCPDump to capture and analyze network traffic when interacting with the form from a Windows VM.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills Learned
- Hosting web content using Apache on Kali Linux
- Transferring files between host and guest systems
- Capturing network traffic with TCPDump
- Analyzing captured packets using PCAP files

---

## üß∞ Tools Used
- **Kali Linux (Oracle VM)**
- **Windows VM (Oracle VM)**
- **Apache Web Server**
- **TCPDump**
- **Wireshark** (optional for PCAP analysis)

## üìã Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Download and Transfer login.html
1. Download the provided `login.html` file
2. Place the file in your shared folder between your Kali VM and host machine
3. Verify the file is in the shared folder by running the following command in the Kali terminal:
   ```bash
   ls /media/sf_<shared_folder_name>
   ```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Move login.html to the Apache Web Server Directory
1. Copy the login.html file to the web server's root directory:
   ```bash
   sudo cp /media/sf_<shared_folder_name>/login.html /var/www/html/
   ```
2. Verify that the file has been moved successfully:
   ```bash
   ls /var/www/html/
   ```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Proper Permissions
1. Adjust the file permissions to ensure it is accessible by the web server:
   ```bash
   sudo chmod 644 /var/www/html/login.html
   ```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Restart the Apache Server
1. Restart the Apache2 service to apply changes:
   ```bash
   sudo service apache2 restart
   ```

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Access the Form from Windows
1. On your Windows VM, open a web browser.
2. Enter the following URL, replacing `<Kali_IP>` with your Kali machine's IP address:
   ```
   http://<Kali_IP>/login.html
   ```
‚úÖ You should see the login form displayed in the browser.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Capture Traffic with TCPDump
1. On Kali Linux, open a terminal and run the following command to start TCPDump on the eth0 interface and save the captured traffic to a PCAP file:
   ```bash
   sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w /home/kali/login.pcap
   ```

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Interact with the Login Form
1. Go back to your Windows VM where the login.html form is open in the browser
2. Enter a random username and password, then click Submit

‚úÖ **TCPDump** on the **Kali VM** should capture the network traffic generated by the form submission.

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Stop TCPDump
1. Go back to the Kali terminal where TCPDump is running
2. Stop the capture by pressing Ctrl + C.

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Verify the Capture File
1. Ensure the PCAP file was created by listing the contents of your home directory:
   ```bash
   ls /home/kali/login.pcap
   ```

‚úÖ The **`login.pcap`** file should be present in your home **directory**

## üéØ Summary
In this project, a **login form** was hosted on an **Apache web server** running on **Kali Linux**, and network traffic generated from a **Windows VM** interacting with the form was captured using **TCPDump**. The captured traffic was saved as a **PCAP file**, which can be further analyzed using tools like **Wireshark** to inspect the data packets and identify potential vulnerabilities.
